React is a client based application, Application runs faster and smoother with react

React generally doesn't let you route 

REACT-ROUTING is a third party library(it doesn't come with react sxo we need to install it).

ROUTING is navigation(direction)
We have ROUTES AND 
ROUTE (this gives the exact direction, the path to take, and gives the exact component to render )

routes need to be inside of App.js because that is the point of entry for all the components we want to render
